## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My chosen dataset contains economic, banking and systemic crisis data for 13 African countries from 1860 to 2014. For my project, I will analyze this data to determine which countries have experienced economic crises since the year 2000. More specifically, I will identify which countries experienced a domestic and/or a external debt default during this period. I will also identify which countries experienced the most frequent domestic and external debt defaults. Moreover, I will examine inflation and exchange rates (relative to the USD) for these countries during the same period to determine which countries had the highest inflation and the weakest currencies. My interest in this dataset lies in the fact that I'm an economics major, but I know little about the economic environment in a variety of African countries. Hopefully this project will shed light on certain macroeconomic indicators for the countries that are included in this dataset. In addition, I feel like there is a lot of potential for effective data visualization with this dataset. Given that the data is based on geography, I could possibly use a map for visualization purposes. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My dataset is from kaggle, and according to its publisher it "is a derivative of Reinhart et. al's Global Financial Stability dataset", which can be found on Harvard Business School's website. It is titled "Africa Economic, Banking and Systemic Crisis Data - Data on Economic and Financial crises in 13 African Countries (1860 to 2014)". It is focused on banking, systemic crises, debt crises, exchange rates, consumer price index (CPI) data, and inflation rates over the course of over five decades. The countries included in this dataset are Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. According to the information about the dataset that this dataset is derived from, the data was collected over the course of many years by Carmen Reinhart et. al. According to the description provided on kaggle, "the dataset will be valuable to those who seek to understand the dynamics of financial stability within the African context." Therefore, this dataset appears to have been collected for the purpose of public interest and education.
